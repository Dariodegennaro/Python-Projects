# Python-Projects
Experiments and projects to prove my progress while studying Python

I know for many people here on GitHub these projects are like a baby learn to say "mom" or "dad", but everyone started from here. 
Please feel free to review my projects and comment or modify it to show me how it could be improved. 

Ciao. 
Dario.
